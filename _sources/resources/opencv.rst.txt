OpenCV
------

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions for real-time computer vision. OpenCV is powering most of phenopype's image analysis functions so that phenopype is - in large parts, but not exclusively - a wrapper for OpenCV. If you would like to see more OpenCV function being integrated into phenpype, please get in touch with me.
